CAD-Final-Phone-Case
====================

My CAD Class Final Project. It is an iPhone 5C case with space for a built-in *iQi Mobile Wireless Charger*.

Folder Structure
================

The root of this repo will contain the main Autodesk Inventor part file, and the stl folder will contain stl files of each separate part, for GitHub 3D diffing.
