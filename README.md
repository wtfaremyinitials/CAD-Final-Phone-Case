CAD Final Phone Case
====================

My CAD Class Final Project. It is an iPhone 5C case that is capable of wirelessly charging the phone.

Folder Structure
================

The root of this repo will contain the main Autodesk Inventor part file, and the stl folder will contain stl files of each solid body part, for GitHub 3D diffing.

Time Management

Problem Statement
=================

The problem is that needing to plug in a phone at night to charge is annoying and not convenient.



Research
========

- *Take apart the phone and hack wireless charging into the internals of the phone itself*
	- Good
		- The final product would be completely seamless, no case required.
		- There is no way to lose the product, as it would be part of the phone.
	- Bad
		- Modifying the inside of cellphones is extremely difficult.
		- This method would require soldering skills.
		- It is near impossible to do in recent iPhones due to no space inside the phone.
	- Ugly
		- The phone might not look the same after being opened and modified.
		- There is a possibility of ruining the phone when you start modifying it with a soldering iron.
		- Opening and modifying the phone voids the warranty.

- *Cases made by other companies*
	- Good
		- This solution is good because its a consumer product so there's a guarantee that it will actually work.
		- Going with this solution means that the case is backed by a large company, so there would be support available.
		- The final product would be very well tested.
	- Bad
		- Almost all consumer case designs are extremely bulky.
		- The case listed below uses proprietary hardware, so you would be required to use their chargers.
	- Ugly
		- Their case design looks absolutely terrible.

- *Wireless charging inserts*
	- Good
		- Using an insert allows you to use any case.
		- These wireless charging inserts are backed by a large company.
		- They have been thoroughly tested.
		- Using this allows you to use existing charging peripherals.
	- Bad
		- The insert itself bends and warps cases due to added size.
		- The connector is visible at the bottom of the phone, because cases are not designed for these inserts.
	- Ugly
		- The insert itself does not look appealing.
