CAD Final Phone Case
====================

My CAD Class Final Project. It is an iPhone 5C case that is capable of wirelessly charging the phone.

Folder Structure
================

The root of this repo will contain the main Autodesk Inventor part file, and the stl folder will contain stl files of each solid body part, for GitHub 3D diffing.

Time Management

Problem Statement
=================

The problem is that needing to plug in a phone at night to charge is annoying and not convenient.



Research
========

It is possible to hack wireless charging into the phone itself, but it is extremely difficult.[0](http://lifehacker.com/5598744/hack-an-induction-charger-to-work-with-any-cellphone)

It is even harder to do this on the iPhone because it requires you to rebuild the entire backplate.[1](http://lifehacker.com/5923977/mod-your-iphone-for-wireless-charging-no-bulky-case-required)

There are commercial products available to do just this, but the cases are extremely bulky[2](http://www.duracellpowermat.com/) and use proprietary hardware.

Qi is a very well adopted standard in wireless charging with many cool charging accessories and docks[4](http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/01/08/hands-on-the-air-dock-wireless-car-charger-might-get-everything-right/) [5](https://www.google.com/search?q=qi+charger#q=qi+charger&tbm=shop)
