CAD Final Phone Case
====================

My CAD Class Final Project. It is an iPhone 5C case that is capable of wirelessly charging the phone.

Folder Structure
================

The root of this repo will contain the main Autodesk Inventor part file, and the stl folder will contain stl files of each solid body part, for GitHub 3D diffing.

Time Management

Problem Statement
=================

The problem is that needing to plug in a phone at night to charge is annoying and not convenient.



Research
========

- *Take apart the phone and hack wireless charging into the internals of the phone itself*
	- Good
		- Seamless
		- No way the system could randomly break
	- Bad
		- Extremely hard to do
		- Requires soldering skills
		- Near impossible to do in recent iPhones due to no space inside the phone
	- Ugly
		- The phone might not look the same after being opened and modded

- *Cases made by other companies*
	- Good
		- Guaranteed to work
		- Backed by a large company
		- Thoroughly tested
		- All the work is done
	- Bad

- *Wireless charging inserts*
	- Good
		- Allows you to use any case
		- Backed by a large company
		- Tested
		- Allows you to use existing charging peripherals
	- Bad
		- Bends and warps cases due to added size
		- The connector is visible at the bottom of the phone
	- Ugly
		- Most inserts itself look really bad
